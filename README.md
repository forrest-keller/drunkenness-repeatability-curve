# The Drunkenness-Repeatability Curve Project

## Introduction

Dark times are upon us. As people return to "being on AUX", some have forgotten that there is a correlation between the drunkenness of the members of the party and the repeatability of a given song. The horrors that unfold when this correlation is not taken seriously are too grave to muster. Thus, the Drunkenness-Repeatability Curve (henceforth shortened to D-R Curve) project was born with the goal to reduce the amount of suffering caused in these situations.

## Getting Started

First, install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For a full list of available scripts, see `package.json`

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the output of the development server.
